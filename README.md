# Optimizing IVF Operations for Efficiency and Care Optimizing

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing operational workflows in IVF (In-Vitro Fertilization) clinics using data analytics, performance metrics, and Power BI dashboards. It includes Python analysis, project architecture documentation, dashboards, and a final presentation.

# Project Overview  
IVF processes involve multiple time-sensitive steps such as patient consultations, lab operations, sample handling, and reporting. This project uses data-driven insights to identify workflow inefficiencies and recommend operational improvements.

# Business Problem: IVF clinics face inefficiencies in appointment scheduling, staff allocation, and
equipment usage. Patients experience long wait times, lowering satisfaction and clinic
throughput. Staff workloads are imbalanced, causing burnout or idle time. These inefficiencies
drive up operational costs and reduce overall efficiency.

# High Level Solution: Use predictive analytics and optimization models on historical clinic data to
improve scheduling and resource allocation. Provide real-time dashboards and reports for
continuous monitoring and refinement.

# Business Objective:

Maximize patient satisfaction and clinic throughput by improving appointment scheduling, staff
allocation, and equipment utilization.

# Business Constraint:

Minimize wait times, staff overload/idle time, and operational costs.

### Success criteria:

#### Business Success Criteria:
Improve patient satisfaction and clinic throughput by optimizing staff and equipment utilization.

# Economic Success Criteria:

Reduce operational costs and increase revenue through efficient resource allocation.
