Optimizing IVF Operations for Efficiency and Care Optimizing

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing operational workflows in IVF (In-Vitro Fertilization) clinics using data analytics, performance metrics, and Power BI dashboards.
It includes Python analysis, project architecture documentation, dashboards, and a final presentation.

📌 Project Overview

IVF processes involve multiple time-sensitive steps such as patient consultations, lab operations, sample handling, and reporting.
This project uses data-driven insights to identify workflow inefficiencies and recommend operational improvements.

This repository contains:

Python Jupyter Notebook

Power BI Dashboard

Project Architecture Document

Project Presentation Slides

🏗️ Project Architecture
